# Uploading WordPress theme updates via SVN on Mac

## About
Themes authors can now update themes using SVN. This tutorial provides the steps to update WordPress themes using SVN on Mac. 

## Background
Mac includes `.DS_Store` and `__MACOSX` when compressing files. They are hidden files and often triggers an error if they are not removed prior to the Zip upload. SVN allows Mac users remove hidden unnesseary files or folders and streamline automation. 

## What you will need
- MacOS 
- [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [SVN module](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnstoncode.svn-scm)



## Instruction
(1) Create a copy of repository on your local machine. Replace `/NameOfYourTheme/` with your theme name. 

 ```
 
 svn co https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/NameOfYourTheme/
 
 ```
 

(2) Next step is to create a new directory and copy all theme files from the current version of the theme. 
In the example below, we are creating a new directoy `1.0.2` and copy all files from the version `1.0.1`.

```

cp -R /Users/Desktop/NameOfYourTheme/1.0.1 /Users/Desktop/NameOfYourTheme/1.0.2

```

Note: Update MUST be stored in a directory using the version number.  
For example, if you are current theme is `1.2.3`, the new directory MUST be `1.2.4`.   e.g. `/NameofYourTheme/1.3`

Note: To get the full path to the current version of your theme using VS code on Mac, you can simply drag the folder of the folder into the terminal area to get the path. 

(3) Add the new directory to local working group. Replace `1.0.2` with the new directory you just created. 

```

svn add 1.0.2

```

(4) Make changes on your theme.  Make sure to update the version number on Style.css, and the Changelog on readme.txt 

(5) Once you are happy with updates, you are ready to submit the update. 
First make sure to remove .DS_Store hidden file. 

```

find . -name ".DS_Store" -print -delete

```

(6) Then make sure to remove __MACOSX folder.

```

rm -R __MACOSX

```

(7) Finally you are ready to commit.

```

Svn commit -m “Fix typo on readme.txt”

```

Note: once you commit, absolutely no way to change or modify what you just commit. If you find any mistakes including a small typo, only way to fix is to start over from step 2, create new directory and upload again. 

## What to expect next
Once you successfuly upload the new changes, you will receive a confirmation email from WordPress.org. It may take some time to reflect on the WordPress.org directory.
